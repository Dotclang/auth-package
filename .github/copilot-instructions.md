# AuthPackage — Copilot / AI agent instructions

- Project type: Laravel package (PSR-12 namespaced under `Dotclang\AuthPackage`) intended to be installed via Composer into host Laravel applications.

- using validation requests: leverage Laravel's form request validation for incoming data instead of manual validation in controllers.

- using route middleware: apply middleware from routes files instead of controllers for common tasks (e.g., authentication, authorization).

- UI design requirements (keep these in mind when editing views)
  - Mobile-first: design templates with responsive Tailwind utilities 
  - Dark mode: support Tailwind's `dark:` variants (assume host app may enable `class`-based dark mode).
  - functional components: build reusable Blade components for common UI patterns (e.g., buttons, forms, modals).
  - use function vendors: leverage community-driven Blade component libraries for common UI elements.

- Files to inspect when implementing changes
  - `src/Console/InstallCommand.php` — Artisan command for package installation
  - `src/AuthServiceProvider.php` — provider entrypoints
  - `routes/auth.php` and `routes/web.php` — route definitions and names
  - `src/Http/Controllers/Auth/*` and `src/Http/Requests/*` — request handlers and validation
  - `resources/views/*` — Blade templates (Tailwind classes)
  - `config/auth.php` — package config merged into host `auth` config
  - `src/js` — JavaScript assets (Tailwind classes)
  - `src/css` — CSS assets (Tailwind classes)
