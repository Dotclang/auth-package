# AuthPackage — Copilot / AI agent instructions

- Project type: Laravel package (PSR-12 namespaced under `Dotclang\AuthPackage`) intended to be installed via Composer into host Laravel applications.

- using validation requests classes: leverage Laravel's form request validation for incoming data instead of manual validation in controllers.

- using route middleware: apply middleware from routes files instead of controllers for common tasks (e.g., authentication, authorization).

- using helper functions: leverage Laravel's helper functions for common tasks (e.g., `route()`, `url()`, `asset()`).

- UI design requirements (keep these in mind when editing views)
  - Mobile-first: design templates with responsive Tailwind utilities
  - Dark mode: support Tailwind's `dark:` variants for dark mode compatibility
    - use `dark:` variants for colors and backgrounds
  - functional components: build reusable Blade components for common UI patterns (e.g., buttons, forms, modals).
  - use function vendors: leverage community-driven Blade component libraries for common UI elements.
